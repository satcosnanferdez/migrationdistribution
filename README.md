Stata files are provided in the Do_Files folder. The file 01Master.do
executes the entire analysis.

Most data are provided in the Data folder. LFS microdata files
need to be sourced from the UK Data Archive and placed in folders
named using the format QQYY, where QQ is the quarter, e.g.,
April - June 2002 as AJ02. The Stata files within these folders
should also follow this naming convention, e.g., AJ02/AJ02.dta.
