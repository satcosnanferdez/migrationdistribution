{title:Description}		

 {pstd} {cmd:bartik_weight} calculates the Rotemberg weights over the	
instruments specified in the {varlist} of {it:z(varlist)} using the	
weights defined by {it:weightstub()}. The data needs to be stored in a	
{it: wide} fashion, with a {it:varlist} of instruments and growth 
rates that make up the underlying Bartik instrument.   

 {pstd} For more details, see the {help bartik_weight##remarks:remarks}	
and Goldsmith-Pinkham, Sorkin and Swift (2018).

 {dlgtab:Main}	       

 {phang}{opt y(varname)} specifies the outcome variable in the structural equation. {opt y()} is required.	

 {phang}{opt x(varname)} specifies the endogeneous variable in the structural equation. {opt x()} is required. 	

 {phang}{opt z(varlist)} specifies the {it:varlist} instruments used to	      
make up the Bartik instrument. See Goldsmith-Pinkham, Sorkin and Swift	      
(2018) for a full description. {opt z()} is required. 

 {phang}{opt weightstub(varlist)} specifies the {it:varlist} weights	
used to make up the weight matrix for the Rotemberg weights. These	
weights will be collapsed to constract a single matrix. See  
Goldsmith-Pinkham, Sorkin and Swift (2018) for a full	
description. {opt weightstub()} is required.   

 {dlgtab:Options} 

 {phang} {opt controls(varlist)} is the list of variables used as	
controls in the main regression. In cases with a variable that 
generates a lot of fixed effects (such as a location F.E.), the {opt absorb(varname)}	
option can be used, and the program will construct   
temporary variables to run the regression.	     

 {phang} {opt absorb(varname)} specifies the categorical variable,	
which is to be included in the regression as if it were specified by	
dummy variables.	

 {phang}{opt weight_var(varname)} specifies the weight variable used to	
weight the regression. In a standard regression, the {it:varname}    
would be the variable used in {cmd:[aweight=varname]}.		     

 {phang}{opt by(varname)} specifies name of the time variable that is	
interacted with the shares. The variable is omitted when the  
regression is a cross-section, while in a panel setting, this would be	
each time period that the national growth rates are defined in.     


 {marker remarks}{...}	  
{title:Remarks}		  

 {pstd} This program estimates the Rotemberg weights outlined in	
Goldsmith-Pinkham, Sorkin and Swift (2018). Each weight returned in	
{cmd:r(alpha)} corresponds to the misspecification elasticity for each	
individual instrument, when using the Bartik instrument defined by the	
weights in {opt weightstub()}.	  

 {pstd} The key errors or issues that can come up are that the	
instruments or controls are collinear. For two example of do-files	
implementing this process, see {it:example_BAR.do} and {it:example_ADH.do} which	
implement the program using real data. 		   

 {pstd}	  
For detailed information on the Rotemberg weights statistic, see Goldsmith-Pinkham, Sorkin and Swift (2018).	


 {marker examples}{...}	 
{title:Examples}	 

 {phang}Three simple examples:	
{phang2}{cmd:. bartik_weight, z(ind_sh_*)  weightstub(growth_*) x(emp_ch) y(wage_ch) {p_end}}	

 {phang2}{cmd:. bartik_weight, z(t*_init_sh_ind_*)    weightstub(nat_empl_ind_*) x(emp_ch) y(wage_ch)  controls(`controls') weight_var(pop1980)  absorb(czone)}{p_end} 

 {phang2}{cmd:. bartik_weight, z(t*_sh_ind_*)  weightstub(trade_*) x(d_tradeusch_pw) y(d_sh_empl_mfg)  controls(`controls') weight_var(timepwt48)}{p_end}	       

 {phang}  For code to convert returned matrices into a dataset, see example_ADH.do or example_BAR.do.
